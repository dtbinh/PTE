# Dynamics

Code that performs dynamics computations for different models go here.

* It should only contain code for the dynamics of a system (Manipulator equations).
* Each function must take in the full state of the system.
* Each system must have it's own sub directory.
* The functions in this directory must only be called by other functions/scripts.
