# Trajectory Optimization

Code to obtain trajectory optimization solutions.

* Each trajectory optimization model must be in its own sub-directory.
* Each algorithm must be model and dynamics independent. The dynamics function must be passed as a parameter.
* The functions in this directory must only be called by other functions/scripts.
